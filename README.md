## Inference C++ models using SageMaker Processing


Machine learning has been existing for decades. Before the prevalence of doing machine learning with Python, many other languages such as Java, C++ were used to build models. Refactoring legacy models in C++ or Java could be forbiddingly expensive and time consuming. Our customer would like to know if they can bring their legacy models writing in languages such as C++ to the cloud.

In this example, we are going demonstrate inferencing C++ models by building a customer container first and then run a ScriptProcessor jobs.
